Hi! My name is Nicole Meng, a second year CS PhD student at [Tufts university](https://www.tufts.edu/) working in the [Cybersecurity and Knowledge Computing Lab](https://laogroup.ece.tufts.edu/) under [Prof. Yingjie Lao](https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/people/faculty/yingjie-lao). I received my M.S. in computer science and engineering from [UConn](https://uconn.edu/) under the guidance of [Prof. Caiwen Ding](https://caiwending.github.io/web/home.html). My M.S. was fully funded by both the [USDA-NIFA Research Program](https://www.nifa.usda.gov/grants/programs/agriculture-food-research-initiative) and the [Synchrony Fellowship of Excellence in Cybersecurity](https://cacc.engr.uconn.edu/about/centers/synchrony/). Before that, I received my B.S. from [Brandeis University](https://www.brandeis.edu/), with a triple major in computer science, applied math, and economics. I graduated Brandeis with the highest honors in computer science, and as the sole recipient for the 2023 [Jacque Cohen Award](https://www.brandeis.edu/computer-science/undergraduate/jacques_cohen.html) for research excellence.

My research focus includes AI security and privacy, generative 3D vision models, and agentic security. In general, I am interested in exploring the security vulnerbilities and privacy concerns of generative vision models, and developing defensive solutions that ensures model robustness. 

Outside of research, I play tennis at the [Mouratoglou Tennis
Center](https://www.mouratoglou.com/en/international/boston/), under coach [Massimo Boscato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimo_Boscatto) and [Massimo Policastro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/massimo-policastro-17b4b979/). Seasonally, I SKI THE EAST and surf on the cape! I played in the [Brandeis Women's Rugby Team](https://campusgroups.brandeis.edu/womensrugby/home/) in college, and before that, I was a National Second-level Athelete for basketball in China.
